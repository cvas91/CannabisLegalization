**Abstract:**
- Uruguay was the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational consumption in 2013. Its effects have been a public health concern in the last decade across the continent as more countries examine similar strategies. 
- This paper aims to measure the post-legalization impact on the prevalence of cannabis use disorder among Uruguayan consumers by constructing a synthetic control method covering data from 1990 to 2017 through 19 Latin American countries. 
- The findings suggest that the prevalence of cannabis use disorder decreased in Uruguay after the legalization. However, these results are not unique since placebo tests indicate that other countries would have experienced similar outcomes. 
- Thus, it cannot be confirmed that the decreasing effect in the prevalence of cannabis disorders is only due to the legalization in 2013. 
- The added value of this paper is to add empirical econometric research to public health studies in Latin America.

**Motivation**
- Abuse of illegal substances is a global struggle that significantly impacts individuals and society. 
- Roth et al. (2018) reported that worldwide smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use kill directly and indirectly 11.8 million people annually, exceeding the total number of deaths caused by all types of cancer. 
- Direct deaths from alcohol and illicit drug use disorders estimate that over 350,000 people die each year globally, with over half of these deaths occurring in males younger than 50. 
- Substance abuse also contributes to the global disease burden, with 1.5% resulting from alcohol and illicit drug addiction; in some countries like the U.S., it is over 5%. Additionally, over 2% of the world population has an alcohol or illicit drug addiction.
