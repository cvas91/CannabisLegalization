# Prevalence of Cannabis Use Disorder Post Legalization – Uruguay Case Study

 Author: [Camilo Vargas](https://www.github.com/cvas91)

**Abstract:**
- Uruguay was the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational consumption in 2013. Its effects have been a public health concern in the last decade across the continent as more countries examine similar strategies. 
- This paper aims to measure the post-legalization impact on the prevalence of cannabis use disorder among Uruguayan consumers by constructing a synthetic control method covering data from 1990 to 2017 through 19 Latin American countries. 
- The findings suggest that the prevalence of cannabis use disorder decreased in Uruguay after the legalization. However, these results are not unique since placebo tests indicate that other countries would have experienced similar outcomes. 
- Thus, it cannot be confirmed that the decreasing effect in the prevalence of cannabis disorders is only due to the legalization in 2013. 
- The added value of this paper is to add empirical econometric research to public health studies in Latin America.

**Motivation**
- Abuse of illegal substances is a global struggle that significantly impacts individuals and society. 
- Roth et al. (2018) reported that worldwide smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use kill directly and indirectly 11.8 million people annually, exceeding the total number of deaths caused by all types of cancer. 
- Direct deaths from alcohol and illicit drug use disorders estimate that over 350,000 people die each year globally, with over half of these deaths occurring in males younger than 50. 
- Substance abuse also contributes to the global disease burden, with 1.5% resulting from alcohol and illicit drug addiction; in some countries like the U.S., it is over 5%. Additionally, over 2% of the world population has an alcohol or illicit drug addiction.

**Data**

Panel data across 27 years from 1990 to 2017 for a total sample of 19 Latin American countries. 
- Data on the prevalence of drug use disorders is drawn from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2019). These data measure the number of persons of both sexes and all ages per country and year that have reported the prevalence use disorder of the following substances: amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, opioid and other drugs. 
- Public healthcare indicators per country and year are drawn from the World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure database. 
- Macroeconomic and demographic variables per country and year are drawn from the World Bank – World Development Indicators.

The descriptive statistics of the variables are summarized as follows.

**Synthetic Control Method (SCM)**

Introduced by Abadie et al. (2010) when developing a new statistical approach to evaluate an intervention's impact in comparative case studies. This method involves constructing a weighted combination of control groups to which the treatment group is compared. The comparison is then used to estimate the counterfactual outcome for the treatment group if it had not received the treatment.
