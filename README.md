# Prevalence of Cannabis Use Disorder Post Legalization â€“ Uruguay Case Study


**Abstract:**
Uruguay was the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational consumption in 2013. Its effects have been a public health concern in the last decade across the continent as more countries examine similar strategies. This paper aims to measure the post-legalization impact on the prevalence of cannabis use disorder among Uruguayan consumers by constructing a synthetic control method covering data from 1990 to 2017 through 19 Latin American countries. The findings suggest that the prevalence of cannabis use disorder decreased in Uruguay after the legalization. However, these results are not unique since placebo tests indicate that other countries would have experienced similar outcomes. Thus, it cannot be confirmed that the decreasing effect in the prevalence of cannabis disorders is only due to the legalization in 2013. The added value of this paper is to add empirical research to public health studies in Latin America.
